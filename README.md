Intellinote (Design & UI)

This is the design playground and frontend shell for Intellinote, an AI study helper I’m building to turn messy notes and PDFs into clean summaries, quizzes, and flashcards.

What’s in here?

Since this is just the design repo, it’s mostly about the "look and feel." I’m focusing on:

    Dark Mode UI: Keeping it easy on the eyes for late-night study sessions.

    Minimalist Layout: A clean interface that doesn't get in the way of learning.

    Component Visuals: The UI for the PDF reader, flashcard decks, and quiz generators.

The Big Picture

The actual "brain" of the app (the AI logic and database) lives in the main program repository. This repo is purely for building out the frontend components and making sure everything looks right before I wire up the backend.

Quick Start

If you just want to see the visuals running locally:

    git clone https://github.com/SaMoBTW/Intellinote-design.git

    npm install

    npm run dev
